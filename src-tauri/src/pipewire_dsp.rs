/// Builds and starts a standalone `pipewire -c <generated config>` process

/// instance per (device, effect) pair actually in use — not per row, and not
/// one giant shared module either. `chains` has one `DeviceChainSpec` per
/// distinct device among the live `ShakerChannel` set (see its own doc
/// comment for what "1 chain per device" means).
///
/// Each effect's module has a capture sink with `output_channel_count`
/// channels — matching *that device's* own channel count exactly (e.g. 4) —
/// targeted directly by that effect's own corner rows on that device, each
/// with its **real, untouched `pan`/`channels` values**, exactly as
/// Monocoque's original pre-DSP config used them. Monocoque's own
/// `cv.values[pan]` gating (the same mechanism the pre-DSP config always
/// relied on) does the per-corner separation *for us*, writing each row's
/// audio onto its own distinct channel of this shared sink — no per-row
/// mono sink, no per-row `stream.dont-remix`/`audio.position` trick needed
/// at the capture side at all. This is the mechanism that fixed real-hardware
/// routing this session (see the historical note below) — grouping the
/// filter-chain by device does not change it, it just runs it once per
/// device instead of once globally.
///
/// Internally, each of the sink's `output_channel_count` channels gets its
/// own isolated `bq_lowpass` -> `linear` (LPF + fader) chain, wired *directly*
/// to the real output channel that corner's `pan` targets — a straight
/// remap, not a broadcast gate, since within one effect on one device each
/// corner has a distinct target. Multiple *different* effects (or the same
/// effect on a different device) targeting the same real output channel of
/// the same device still sum together natively via PipeWire's own sink
/// mixing when their independent playback streams reach the same target
/// device — this is exactly why per-effect modules don't need to be merged
/// into one shared capture sink even when several land on one physical
/// channel.
///
/// This replaced an earlier design where every row got its own **mono**
/// capture sink and a mono playback stream with a single-entry
/// `audio.position` (e.g. `["RL"]`) plus `stream.dont-remix: true` to land
/// on one channel of the real device — which additionally required
/// temporarily rewriting each row's `pan` to 0 and `channels` to 1 in the
/// exported Monocoque config while DSP was enabled. That mono+dont-remix+
/// position-label approach turned out to be unreliable on real hardware for
/// non-front channel positions specifically: hands-on testing (objective
/// `parec` capture during a real `monocoque test` run, with the
/// known-working pre-DSP backup config as a working reference on the exact
/// same physical device) showed rear-channel audio reaching the real output
/// via the backup config's native multi-channel + per-channel-volume
/// approach, while the mono+dont-remix+`["RL"]`/`["RR"]` streams produced
/// literally zero signal — both at the real device and even at the row's
/// own capture sink (i.e. the whole per-row filter-chain node never reached
/// a running state) — and separately, the engine effect specifically was
/// observed not reaching all 4 output channels even after that was fixed.
/// Reusing Monocoque's own native multi-channel-stream + per-channel-volume
/// mechanism — proven to work on every channel — instead of a filter-chain-
/// side position-relabeling trick sidesteps both problems.
///
/// Returns the child process's PID (also cached in FILTER_CHAIN_PID). The

/// process — confirmed via hands-on testing that multiple
